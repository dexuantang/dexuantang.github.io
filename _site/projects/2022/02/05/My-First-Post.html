<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>I built this robot in September 2019, the idea was to build a very simple robot used as a prop for my highschool engineering club trailer. I did some searching and found out using only two servos and making the legs tilted so that the legs can act as pivots can make a robot move in all 3 directions except backing up.</p>

<p>Coming up with a method for the robot to turn was the most challenging part and the final solution was to adjust the timing and angle of the servoâ€™s movements. After designing the frame of the robot in Fusion 360 and printed it out and
  connecting all the electronics(consists of an Arduino UNO, a Bluetooth receiver and two servos),</p>

<p>I programmed the robot in Arduino IDE and used a Android APP to send commands through Bluetooth</p>
